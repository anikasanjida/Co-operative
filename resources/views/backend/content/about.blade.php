                <p>The purpose of a cooperative is to realize the economic, cultural and social needs of the organization's
                    members and
                    its surrounding community Cooperatives often have a strong commitment to their community and a focus on
                    strengthening the community they exist in or serve.
                    We have built a software system to automate co-operative banking operations.
                    The product is built to reduce manual paper work and also addresses various security
                    concerns related to data loss and backup of confidential information.
                    The software contains many modules which will ease the management of users,
                    customers, transactions and accounts. The software product is highly reliable
                    and has a discrete module to generate reports. The software is controlled by
                    the administrator who has the freedom to establish access rights to the users.</p>
